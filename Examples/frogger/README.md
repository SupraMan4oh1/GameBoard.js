==============================================================
Most everything has been implemented correctly.
So far, I've found the following bugs:

Collision and death detection works most of the time but not always. There's something very minute that I'm missing that I can't find.
The death image does get drawn but not in a well or consistent matter.
There are a few issues with objects being used at the same time. There might be a threading fix but I'm not sure.

I spent about 50 hours on this assignment. I discussed the project with Ilan Gray and Caleb Malchik.

The additional features I implemented are:

Sound
Level Progression
Death Image

Personal Thoughts
-----------------
I think I made this too ambitious of a project by attempting to make an entire independent javascript library for HTML5 games. I still had to write a fair amount of custom code for Frogger, which can be found in game.js. The library will be under heavy development in the next few weeks and can be found at http://github.com/shadowthekid/GameBoard.js. Oh and I wrote it so I didn't take it from anywhere.
